# Student Batch Management System

## Overview
Complete student batch management system with card-based UI for multiple batch enrollments and integrated admin approval system.

## Features Implemented

### Task 1: Card System for Enrolled Batches ✅

#### 1. **Student Batches Page** (`/dashboard/student/batches`)
- **Beautiful Card Layout**: Modern card-based UI showing all enrolled batches
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Clear badges for enrollment and payment status
- **Batch Information Display**:
  - Cover photo or default gradient
  - Batch name and description
  - Mentor information
  - Course type (Online/Offline)
  - Duration and enrollment date
  - Price paid
  - Progress tracking with visual bar

#### 2. **Multiple Batch Support**
- Students can enroll in multiple batches simultaneously
- Each batch has its own card showing individual progress
- Separate management page for each batch
- No conflicts between multiple enrollments

#### 3. **Individual Batch Management** (`/dashboard/student/batches/[id]`)
- Complete Google Classroom-style interface
- Four main tabs:
  - **Overview**: Course info, modules, mentor details, progress
  - **Schedule**: Live class schedules with join buttons
  - **Assignments**: Assignment management with status tracking
  - **Discussions**: Forum for class discussions

#### 4. **Status Management**
- **Pending Status**: Shows warning, access restricted
- **Approved Status**: Full access to all features
- **Rejected Status**: Clear indication, no access
- **Completed Status**: Shows as completed course

### Task 2: Fixed Admin Approval System ✅

#### 1. **Database Update Issues Fixed**
The system now properly updates both:
- **User Model**: `approvalStatus` field updated
- **Enrollment Model**: `status` field updated automatically

#### 2. **Approval Flow**
```
Student Enrolls → Admin Approves → Both Models Updated → Student Gets Access
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
Added comprehensive logging in `/api/admin/student-approvals`:
- Logs user approval status updates
- Logs enrollment status updates
- Shows count of modified enrollments
- Debug information returned in API response

#### 4. **Payment Approval Integration**
Payment verification also updates enrollment:
- When payment is verified → enrollment status = 'approved'
- Automatically updates both payment and enrollment status
- Student gets immediate access after payment approval

## File Structure

### Frontend Pages
```

├── dashboard/
│   └── student/
│       └── batches/
│           ├── page.tsx                    # Card-based batch list
│           └── [id]/
│               └── page.tsx                # Individual batch management
```

### API Routes
```

└── api/
    ├── admin/
    │   ├── student-approvals/route.ts      # Student approval (updates both models)

## How It Works

### Student Enrollment Process

1. **Student Enrolls in Batch**
   - Enrollment created with `status: 'pending'`
   - Student sees batch in their dashboard with "Pending Approval" badge

2. **Admin Reviews and Approves**
   - Admin goes to `/dashboard` (main admin dashboard)
   - Sees pending students in approval system
   - Clicks "অনুমোদন" (Approve) button
   - System updates:
     - `User.approvalStatus` → 'approved'
     - `Enrollment.status` → 'approved'

3. **Student Payment**
   - Student submits payment from `/dashboard/student/payment`
   - Payment status: 'pending'

4. **Admin Verifies Payment**
   - Admin goes to `/dashboard/payments`
   - Reviews and verifies payment
   - System updates:
     - `Payment.status` → 'verified'
     - `Enrollment.paymentStatus` → 'paid'
     - `Invoice` updated with paid amount

5. **Student Gets Full Access**
   - Student dashboard shows "Active" status
   - Full access to:
     - Class schedules
     - Assignments
     - Discussions
     - Course materials

### Multiple Batch Management

Students can enroll in multiple batches:

```
Student Dashboard
├── Batch 1 (MERN Stack) - Active
│   ├── Schedule
│   ├── Assignments
│   └── Discussions
├── Batch 2 (Graphic Design) - Pending
└── Batch 3 (Digital Marketing) - Active
```

Each batch is completely independent:
- Separate progress tracking
- Individual schedules
- Unique assignments
- Independent discussions
